# Baos Kitchen | Single Page App 

This is a single page app that uses Vanilla Javascript as the barebones to fetch data from a Public API. **Created as part of a Javascript Coding Test**

Using minimal code, there exists an index with one attached stylesheet and script. This will be the only necessary files needed to run if desired locally.

## To use:

```sh
npm install --global http-server
cd /path/to/site
http-server
```

And browse to `localhost:8080`.

## Deploy

The configured app can be deployed to Heroku without requiring node to bundle or compile.
